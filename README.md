# inria_hippocampus
Repo summarizing my studies on the segmentation of the hippocampus during my internship at INRIA Rennes.

## Dataset :
The dataset I used during my internship is called [...] and is constitued of 212 MRI (T1w) with the hippocampus and its subfields manually segmented.
Data are stored with the format "nii.gz" that can easily be read by MedInria to have a 3D vizualisation or Python package "nibabel" to be processed using Python language.
